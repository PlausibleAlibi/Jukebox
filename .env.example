# OAuth Redirect URI Configuration
# 
# RECOMMENDED (RFC 8252 Compliant - for desktop/local use):
# Leave SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI unset (comment out or delete the line below)
# The app will dynamically select a random port on 127.0.0.1
# Configure your Spotify app with: http://127.0.0.1/callback (no port)
#
# ALTERNATIVE (for server/cloud deployments with fixed URLs):
# Uncomment and set to your fixed callback URL
# SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/callback

# Server port (optional, defaults to 3000)
PORT=3000

# Party Features Configuration
# Maximum tracks per IP address (prevents queue flooding)
MAX_TRACKS_PER_IP=5

# Admin password for host controls (skip, remove tracks, etc.)
# Leave empty to disable admin panel
ADMIN_PASSWORD=

# SSL/HTTPS Configuration (optional)
# Enable HTTPS by providing paths to SSL certificate and key files
# When both SSL_CERT_PATH and SSL_KEY_PATH are set, the server runs in HTTPS mode
# You can create certificates for your LAN IP using tools like mkcert:
#   mkcert 192.168.50.159 localhost
#
# SSL_CERT_PATH=./certs/192.168.50.159+1.pem
# SSL_KEY_PATH=./certs/192.168.50.159+1-key.pem
# SSL_PORT=443
# SSL_HOST=192.168.50.159
