# Party Jukebox Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your Spotify credentials

# Spotify API Credentials
# Create an app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# OAuth Redirect URI Configuration
# 
# RECOMMENDED (RFC 8252 Compliant - for desktop/local use):
# Leave SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI unset (comment out or delete the line below)
# The app will dynamically select a random port on 127.0.0.1
# Configure your Spotify app with: http://127.0.0.1/callback (no port)
#
# ALTERNATIVE (for server/cloud deployments with fixed URLs):
# Uncomment and set to your fixed callback URL
# SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/callback

# Server port (optional, defaults to 3000 for HTTP mode)
PORT=3000

# Party Features Configuration
# Maximum tracks per IP address (prevents queue flooding)
MAX_TRACKS_PER_IP=5

# Application Branding
# Customize the app title and byline shown to users
APP_TITLE=Brooklyn's JukeBox
APP_BYLINE=Ring in the New Year with music

# Track Limit Configuration
# Enforce track limits per IP address (true/false)
# When false, users can add unlimited tracks
ENFORCE_TRACK_LIMITS=true

# Admin password for host controls (skip, remove tracks, etc.)
# Leave empty to disable admin panel
ADMIN_PASSWORD=

# Logging Configuration
# Log level controls verbosity of application logs
# Levels (most to least verbose): debug, verbose, info, warn, error
#
# Recommended settings:
# - Production: info (default) or warn
# - Troubleshooting: verbose (detailed operations like cache hits, token checks)
# - Development: debug (full request/response bodies, stack traces)
#
# Default: info
LOG_LEVEL=info

# =============================================================================
# SSL/HTTPS Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Docker deployment runs on HTTPS port 443 by default.
# Enable HTTPS by providing paths to SSL certificate and key files.
#
# REQUIRED for Docker deployment with docker-compose:
# 1. Generate certificates (see README.md for instructions):
#    mkdir -p certs
#    mkcert 192.168.x.x localhost   # Replace with your LAN IP
#
# 2. Uncomment and configure the following (replace with your certificate filenames):
# SSL_CERT_PATH=/app/certs/your-cert.pem
# SSL_KEY_PATH=/app/certs/your-key.pem
# SSL_PORT=443
# SSL_HOST=192.168.x.x  # Optional: specific IP to bind (default: 0.0.0.0)

# For local development (non-Docker, HTTP mode):
# Comment out or remove SSL_CERT_PATH and SSL_KEY_PATH above
#
# Example for mkcert certificates (replace 192.168.50.159 with your LAN IP):
# SSL_CERT_PATH=/app/certs/192.168.50.159+1.pem
# SSL_KEY_PATH=/app/certs/192.168.50.159+1-key.pem
# SSL_PORT=443
# SSL_HOST=192.168.50.159
